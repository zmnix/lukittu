> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While you can self-host Lukittu, it is **not highly recommended**. Lukittu is designed to be a SaaS platform. If you choose to self-host it, keep in mind that, by default, anyone can register and use it unless you implement custom modifications. However, these modifications may make it more difficult to receive updates from upstream when Lukittu is updated.

## Local Development

Lukittu uses a pnpm workspace monorepo structure with the following packages:

- `apps/web`: The core Next.js application
- `apps/bot`: Lukittu's Discord bot
- `packages/shared`: Shared code and utilities

To get started with the project locally, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Setup Environment Variables

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
- Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary details.

#### 2. Install Node.js, Docker, and pnpm

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** v20+ (Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Docker** (Install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started))
- **pnpm** v9.11.0+ (Package manager for Node.js, install via [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/))

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the environment is set up, install dependencies for all workspaces:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 4. Start Local Databases

To start the local databases (PostgreSQL & Redis), use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

This command will spin up the containers for both PostgreSQL and Redis.

#### 5. Run Database Migrations

Run the necessary database migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lukittu/shared migrate
```

#### 6. Start the Application

After the migrations are complete, start the local application:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will run the dev script for all workspaces simultaneously.

To run commands for a specific workspace, use the `--filter` flag:

```bash
# Run Next.js development server only
pnpm --filter lukittu-web dev

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm --filter @lukittu/shared generate
```

#### 7. Access the Application

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should have everything running!

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure Docker is running before starting the databases.
- Make sure to have all environment variables filled correctly in the `.env` file.
- If you encounter dependency issues, try running `pnpm install --force` to refresh dependencies.
