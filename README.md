> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While self-hosting Lukittu is possible, it is **not recommended** for most users. Lukittu is designed as a SaaS platform with proper security measures and ongoing maintenance. If you choose to self-host, be aware that by default anyone can register and use the platform unless you implement custom modifications. These modifications may complicate receiving updates from upstream. For more information about self-hosting requirements and limitations, please refer to our [self-hosting documentation](https://docs.lukittu.com/hosting/self-hosting).

## Local Development

Lukittu uses a pnpm workspace monorepo structure with the following packages:

- `apps/web`: The core Next.js application
- `apps/bot`: Lukittu's Discord bot
- `packages/shared`: Shared code and utilities

To get started with the project locally, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Setup Environment Variables

Lukittu requires three different `.env` files for each part of the application **on local development**:

- **Web Application:** Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env`
- **Bot Application:** Copy `apps/bot/.env.example` to `apps/bot/.env`
- **Shared Package:** Copy `packages/shared/.env.example` to `packages/shared/.env`

Each `.env` file contains configuration specific to its respective application component. Fill in all required values in each file before proceeding.

> **Note:** The `DATABASE_URL` must be consistent across all environment files that require it.

#### 2. Install Node.js, Docker, and pnpm

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** v20+ (Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Docker** (Install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started))
- **pnpm** v9.11.0+ (Package manager for Node.js, install via [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/))

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the environment is set up, install dependencies for all workspaces:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 4. Start Local Databases

To start the local databases (PostgreSQL & Redis), use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

This command will spin up the containers for both PostgreSQL and Redis.

#### 5. Run Database Migrations

Run the necessary database migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
pnpm --filter @lukittu/shared migrate
```

#### 6. Start the Application

After the migrations are complete, start the local application:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will run the dev script for all workspaces simultaneously.

To run commands for a specific workspace, use the `--filter` flag:

```bash
# Run Next.js development server only
pnpm --filter lukittu-web dev

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm --filter @lukittu/shared generate
```

#### 7. Access the Application

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should have everything running!

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure Docker is running before starting the databases.
- Make sure to have all environment variables filled correctly in the `.env` file.
- If you encounter dependency issues, try running `pnpm install --force` to refresh dependencies.
